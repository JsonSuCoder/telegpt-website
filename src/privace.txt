2.2 Information Collected Automatically
When you use TeleGPT, we may automatically collect:
Usage Data: Information on how you interact with AI features, including which features you used, usage frequency, timestamps of each interaction, and AI response time. This helps us analyze performance and preferences.


Technical Data: System logs related to service operation, such as API requests, error logs, and performance data for diagnostics and stability.


2.3 Information from Telegram API
As a backend service for a Telegram bot, we receive necessary information through the Telegram API to respond to your requests, such as your Telegram User ID and message content. We do not proactively collect any information beyond what is needed to provide the service.

We commit:
 We do not use your data for advertising purposes or serve ads based on your personal data.
4. How We Share Your Information
To deliver TeleGPT’s core functionality, your information may be shared in the following cases:
With AI model providers: Your input (e.g., text, voice data) may be sent to third-party AI model providers for processing. These providers handle data according to their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review their respective privacy policies.


With Telegram: As TeleGPT operates through Telegram’s infrastructure, data like your User ID and message content are processed by Telegram before reaching us and after leaving us. Please refer to Telegram’s Privacy Policy for more details.²


With service providers: We may employ third-party companies and individuals to help us provide, maintain, and analyze our service (e.g., hosting, database management). These providers only access data needed to perform their duties and are obligated not to use it for any other purpose.


Legal requirements: We may disclose your data to comply with legal obligations or valid requests from public authorities (e.g., courts, government agencies).


Business transfers: If TeleGPT is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your data may be transferred as part of that transaction. You will be notified before your data is subjected to a different privacy policy.


With your consent: We may share your information for other purposes not mentioned in this policy only with your explicit consent.


We commit:
 We will never sell your personal data.
5. Data Retention
We retain your data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. For instance, your input may be temporarily retained for processing and generating responses, or for a limited time to improve the service and optimize AI models. Once data is no longer needed, we take reasonable steps to delete or anonymize it.
6. Data Security
We implement commercially reasonable security measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These include encryption during data transmission, access control, and regular security audits.
However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information you transmit to us.
